Tesla Mock Website

Tesla mock website. This website is a mock used just to showcase the skills, programming languages and tools used to create this website and is not used to sell any Tesla products or services. To purchase products and services Tesla please visit their official website at www.tesla.com

Case Studies: I wanted to create a well known brand website to showcase my competence in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am aware that using frameworks like bootstrap and libraries like react improve efficency and saves a lot of time and they are also tools that I know and can use. However, I created the website from scratch without using any frameworks or libraries to showcase how well I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I started by using a !DOCTYPE HTML document with all of the relevent and neccesary elements such at opening and closing html, head and body tags. I then added the meta tags for viewport, keywords, description and gave the website a title like the official Tesla website. I then disigned and favicon image for the websites browser tab using a favicon generator. Next step I wanted to structure the website in sections like how the official Tesla website has different sections on the main page. So having one for Model 3, accessories and energy. Once adding images to all sections I then added buttons to each sections and created a footer. All of this was styled in CSS
